We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible
because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster
than having a server render the page on every request.

## Static Generation

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.

## Server Side Rendering

Server-side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web server generates HTML on-the-fly for each page request. This is in contrast to Client-side Rendering (CSR), where HTML is generated by JavaScript in the browser after the page has loaded.

SSR is advantageous for improving initial page load times and SEO, as the server-rendered HTML is fully indexable by search engines. However, it can be more resource-intensive on the server and may require more sophisticated server setup.

In Next.js, you can use the `getServerSideProps` function to fetch data on each request and render your page server-side. This function runs on every request, which means the server generates HTML for each page in real-time. This is useful for pages that need dynamic data that changes between requests.
