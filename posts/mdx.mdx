## MDX

MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to use JSX in your markdown documents. It is an authorable format that combines Markdown and JSX syntax to enable you to use React components within your content.

```ts
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2;
};

console.log(sum(4, 8)); //12
```

MDX provides you with the full power of components, allowing you to create complex interactive posts and bring an enriched experience to your readers. It opens up a world of possibilities for content creation, from embedding graphs and maps to interactive quizzes and much more.

With MDX, each part of your blog or documentation can be an interactive component. This is a significant step forward in the realm of content and design systems as it bridges the gap between markdown content and React components.

MDX is not only a great tool for content authors but also beneficial for developers. It offers a seamless writing experience like Markdown, but with the power and flexibility of React components. This makes it an excellent choice for use in various applications, including gatsby.js, next.js, or even standalone React applications.

In conclusion, MDX is a robust tool that introduces a unique blend of markdown's simplicity with the power of React components, opening new avenues for content creation and user interaction. It's definitely worth considering if you're looking to take your content to the next level.
